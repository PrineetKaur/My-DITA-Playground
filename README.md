# DITA Playground

This repository is a personal learning and practice space for understanding **DITA (Darwin Information Typing Architecture)** and structured technical documentation.

The goal of this playground is not to showcase a finished product, but to demonstrate **progressive learning**: Starting from core concepts and gradually moving toward more advanced DITA features and workflows.

Each project in this repository is intentionally scoped and added incrementally.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to use this repository

If you are new to DITA, start here:

-   **`00-understanding-dita`**\
    A plain-language introduction to DITA fundamentals, written for
    readers who may not have prior experience with structured authoring.

Then continue through the projects in order:

-   **`01-hello-dita`**\
    A basic DITA project that introduces core topic types (concept,
    task, reference) and shows how topics are assembled using a DITA
    map.

Later projects build on these foundations and explore more advanced concepts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Planned project progression

This repository is being developed step by step. Planned projects include:

-   **`02-reuse-demo`**\
    Demonstrates content reuse using DITA mechanisms such as conrefs and
    keyrefs, and explains why modular documentation matters.

-   **`03-sample-product-docs`**\
    A small but realistic documentation set for a fictional product,
    showing how multiple guides and references can be assembled from
    reusable topics.

-   **`04-conditional-text`**\
    Examples of conditional content for different platforms or audiences
    (for example, Windows vs. macOS, or user vs. admin).

-   **`05-dita-ot-plugin`**\
    An introductory look at DITA Open Toolkit customization, including
    basic build scripts and output customization.

Each project will include its own README explaining learning goals, scope, and design decisions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why this repository exists

This playground focuses on:

-   Understanding **structured authoring principles**, not just DITA syntax
-   Writing documentation based on **user intent**
-   Exploring **content reuse and scalability**
-   Learning how DITA supports automation and multi-channel publishing

The emphasis is on *clarity, structure, and reasoning* rather than completeness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## About the approach

-   Projects are kept intentionally small and focused
-   Advanced features are introduced only after fundamentals are clear
-   Each folder represents a learning milestone
-   Git history reflects a gradual progression over time

This mirrors how structured documentation is learned and applied in real-world teams.

## Notes

This repository uses fictional examples and simplified content for learning purposes. It is not intended to represent production documentation.
