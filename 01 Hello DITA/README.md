# Hello DITA

"A minimal introduction project to DITA authoring" 


## Project Summary
This project aims to show how to separate documentation by User Intent:
- Concepts for explanation
- Tasks for procedures, and
- References for lookup

And then assemble those topics using a DITA map.

## Goals
- Understand the core DITA topic types: concept, task, and reference
- Learn how topics are assembled using a DITA map
- Practice writing valid DITA XML

## Scope
This project intentionally avoids advanced DITA features such as reuse, conditional text, and customization.

## What this Project Demonstrates
- Separation of content by user intent
- Clear topic boundaries
- Basic map-driven structure
