# Sample Product Documentation (DITA)

This project demonstrates how DITA can be used to create a small but realistic documentation set for a fictional product.

The focus is on **structure, reuse, and scalability**, not on the completeness of product features.

## Product overview

**Product name:** FlowTrack  
**Type:** Web-based workflow management tool  

Two primary audiences are documented:

- End users (User Guide)
- System administrators (Admin Guide)

Both guides reuse shared content, such as the product overview and system requirements.

## What this project demonstrates

- Organizing documentation by **audience and purpose**
- Using multiple DITA maps to create different deliverables
- Reusing common topics across guides
- Structuring content as concept, task, and reference topics

## Deliverables

- A top-level product documentation map
- A User Guide assembled from reusable topics
- An Admin Guide assembled from reusable topics

This mirrors how real-world DITA documentation sets are typically organized.
