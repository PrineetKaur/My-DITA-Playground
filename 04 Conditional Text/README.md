# Conditional Text in DITA

This project demonstrates how conditional content can be used to support
different platforms and audiences from a single source.

Instead of duplicating topics, conditions allow specific content to be
included or excluded during publishing.

## Conditions used

This project uses the following conditions:

- **platform**: web, mobile
- **audience**: user, admin

These conditions represent common real-world documentation needs.

## What this project demonstrates

- Using the `audience` attribute for role-based content
- Using a custom `platform` attribute for platform-specific instructions
- Writing topics that contain both shared and conditional information
- Preparing content for filtered outputs

This approach allows documentation teams to maintain one source while
publishing multiple variations.
